         Given a list of Integers representing seat numbers, group them into ranges 1-10, 11-20, and 21-30.
         (Any seat number less than 1, or greater than 30 is invalid, and can be ignored.) Preserve the order
         in which the seat number entered their associated group. Return a list of the grouped Integers 1-10,
