#Variables and Datatypes

This exercise is comprised of fifty word problems. Please read each problem, and then write the code that "solves" it. For instance,  

Problem:

*There are four squirrels, and sixteen acorns. Assuming squirrels have a sense of fairness, how many acorns will each squirrel receive?*

Solution:

```
int acorns = 16;
int squirrels = 4;
int sharePerSquirrel = acorns / squirrels;
```

**Note, If you find yourself stuck on a problem for longer than fifteen minutes, move onto the next, and try again later.**
  
C# source code has been provided for you in this repository. Please fork the repository, and import the code into a new project in your Visual Studio Projects folder.  

The word problems appear in the main method of Program.cs. Your answers should appear immediately under each problem.  Please make sure you have a clean build before submitting your work.

**If you have any questions, or concerns, please see one of the instructors.**
