# Project Organizer Database Access


## Part 1 (Day 1) - Data Access Layer

**Setup:** Create a SQL Server database using the attached SQL script `projects.sql`. 

Complete the CLI application for the project database by implementing the `DepartmentSqlDAL`, `EmployeeSqlDAL`, and `ProjectSqlDAL`.

## Part 2 (Day 2) - Integration Testing

Create a Unit Test project for the **ProjectDB** application. Implement integration tests for the `DepartmentSqlDAL`, `EmployeeSqlDAL`, and `ProjectSqlDAL` classes.

Be sure to clean up any test data so that the database is returned to its original state after the test is completed.
