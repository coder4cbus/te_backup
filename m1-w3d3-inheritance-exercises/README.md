# Inheritance Exercises

## Bank Teller Application

This is a two day set of exercises. Parts I is to be completed on Day One. Parts II and III should be finished on Day Two.

### Day One - Part I 

Create three new classes to represent a bank account, savings account, and a simple checking account.

#### 1) BankAccount  

The BankAccount class represents a simple checking or savings account at a bank. The balance is represented in USD using the DollarAmount type.

1. Implement the `BankAccount` class.


| Property Name | Data Type | Get | Set | Description |
|--------------|-----------|-----|-----|-------------|
| AccountNumber | string | X | X | Returns the account number that the account belongs to. |
| Balance | decimal | X | private | Returns the balance value of the bank account. |

<br />

| Method Name | Return Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Deposit(decimal amountToDeposit) | decimal | Adds amountToDeposit to the current balance, and returns the new balance of the bank account. |
| Withdraw(decimal amountToWithdraw) | decimal | Subtracts amountToWithdraw from the current balance, and returns the new balance of the bank account. |
| Transfer(BankAccount destinationAccount, decimal transferAmount) | void | Withdraws `transferAmount` from this account and deposits it into `destinationAccount`. |

<br />

| Constructor | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| BankAccount() | A new bank account's balance is defaulted to a 0 dollar balance. |

 ```
//Sample Usage
BankAccount b1 = new BankAccount();
BankAccount b2 = new BankAccount();

decimal amountToDeposit = 100.00M;
decimal newBalance = b2.Deposit(amountToDeposit);

decimal amountToTransfer = 50.0M;
b2.Transfer(b1, amountToTransfer);
```   

**2. Write unit tests to validate the state and functionality of your public methods.**

#### 2) CheckingAccount

CheckingAccount extends the BankAccount class you just created, plus the following additional rules:

1. Implement the `CheckingAccount` class.

| Ousing System.Collections.Generic;| Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Withdraw | If the balance falls below $0.00 a $10.00 overdraft fee is also withdrawn from the account. |
| Withdraw | Checking account cannot be more than $100.00 overdrawn. If a withdrawal is requested leaving the account more than $100.00, it fails and the balance remains the same. |

**2. Write unit tests to verify the functionality of your code.**

#### 3) SavingsAccount

SavingsAccount extends the BankAccount class you just created, plus the following additional rules:

| Override Method | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Withdraw | If the current balance is less than $150.00 when a withdrawal is made, an additional $2.00 service charge is withdrawn from the account. |

Customers whose combined account balances are at least $25,000 are considered VIP customers and receive special privileges.  

1. Add a `bool IsVIP` property (you may use a function too if you wish) to the bank customer class that returns true if the sum of all accounts belonging to that customer is at least $25,000 and false otherwise. 

**Write unit tests to verify the functionality of your code.**
